Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Heptacoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Heptacoin uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Heptacoin Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
 .
 This package provides the daemon, heptacoind, and the CLI tool
 heptacoin-cli to interact with the daemon and Heptacoin-Qt, a GUI for Heptacoin
 based on Qt.
